# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

# Contributing
To run the website locally, clone the repo and run
```
  npm start
```

All you need to know in order to contribute is something I don't (very easy), and markdown (also easy)

The standard library docs are located in versioned_docs, where the docs are split into versions (currently only c++14 and c++17).

## Rules
- No copy pasting. I know it sounds obvious, but it needs to be mentioned. The one exception are the synopsis.

## Style
The sidebar is organized into headers, these headers represent folders in /versioned_docs/version-cpp-[version number]/
